# The OWNERS file is the Prow feature that allows you to create an ownership structure across the entire repository.
# This file consists of the list of `approvers` and `reviewers` and `labels`.
#
# The basic structure of this file is as follows:
# reviewers:
#   - githubUser1
#   - githubUser2
#   - githubUserN
# approvers:
#   - githubUser1
#   - githubUser2
#   - girhubUserN
# labels: # optional
#   - label1
#   - label2
# Having the same set of reviewers and approvers is considered a bad practice and should be avoided!
#
#
# You can use multiple OWNERS files across the entire repository to diversify the ownership of specific directories between multiple people.
#
